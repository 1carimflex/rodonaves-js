A JavaScript library to interface with Rodonaves API, it works with Node.js. The [documentation can be found here](https://jonyw4.github.io/rodonaves-js/).

## üåü Features
This library its in **early stages**, so it doesn't have interfaces for all MelhorEnvio features (Your PR is very welcome).

With this library you can:
- Get City By Zip Code
- Get Delivery Time
- Simulate Quote

## üìñ  How to use

```bash
npm install --save rodonaves-js
```

```typescript
import Rodonaves from 'rodonaves-js';

const rodonaves = new Rodonaves(
  'user',
  'password',
);
const response = await rodonaves.getCityByZipCode('12608220');
```

## üìö API Docs

This library provides a promise based interface for all functions. Before you
can use the library, you need to provide authentication details which will be
used through API calls.

For a detailed documentation, see our [Documentation](https://jonyw4.github.io/rodonaves-js/).
